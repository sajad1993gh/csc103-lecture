/* Exercise: write a *binary search* on a sorted vector.  The idea is to

 * 1. open the book to some page in the middle.
 * 2. if the page number was too high, open to the middle of the pages to the
 *    left; if it was too low, open to the middle of the pages to the right
 * 3. continue as above until you found the right page.
 *
 * This might be a little challenging.  Ask questions if you get stuck.
