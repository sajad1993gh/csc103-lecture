/* TODO:
 * 1. Do the reading: in particular Prof. Li's notes

 * 4  make sure you have streamlined the process of editing,
 *    compiling, and testing your program.
 * 5. play with git.  see the tutorial.  be sure to get

/* TODO: write a small program that reads 3 integers (from stdin, using

 * NOTE: we didn't get to it in lecture, but most arithmetic operators
 * will do what you expect (e.g., z = x+y stores the value of x+y in z).
 * TODO: do the same for 5 integers, but ONLY USE TWO VARIABLES! */
