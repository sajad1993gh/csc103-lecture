It is good practice to compile this manually.  Here are the steps:

g++ -c rectangle.cpp   # produces rectangle.o, defining area() and perimeter()
g++ -c main.cpp        # produces main.o, defining main()
# NOTE: main.o contains function call "stubs" for area() and perimeter().
# Need to connect the stubs to actual executable code for those functions:
g++ rectangle.o main.o # connect stubs in main.o to code in rectangle.o

The last command produces `a.out` which you can run.
