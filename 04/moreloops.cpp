	 *    run through an entire space of potential solutions, checking
	 *    each candidate for validity.  This is usually pretty trivial.
	 * 2. Maintaining invariants -- when computing some aggregate function
	 *    of a long list of inputs, initialize a variable to be something
	 *    like "the right answer so far" and then read new inputs one by
	 *    one, *updating your candidate answer* so that after each iteration
	 *    of the loop, it is ALWAYS the "right answer so far".
	 * NOTE: even brute force typically has an invariant hiding somewhere, but
	 * it usually isn't all that interesting.
	 * Let's see some examples: */

		/* NOTE: the *invariant* for this loop is that
		 * min is the smallest value we've read so far.
		 * Initialize min to have this property before the
		 * loop, and then at the end of each iteration, make
		 * sure this property remains true (that is to say,
		 * it's *invariant*!!).

	 * average...  Try to take the following very high level steps:
	 * 1. First, think about how many variables you will need, and for what
	 *    purposes.
	 * 2. Declare the variables, and in comments, state the meaning of each
	 *    variable.
	 * 3. Loop through the input and make sure the meaning of each of your
	 *    variables is preserved at the end of each iteration of the loop.
	 * 4. Finally, print the results.
